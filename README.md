## Project Description

### The Idea 
The website will be a fan-oriented Montreal Canadiens information hub called “HabsZone”. It will focus on making our fans up-to-date team information, stats, schedules, and interactive elements, such as stats and standing. Users can browse team rosters, see game schedules, view highlights, and communicate with other fans about any topic relating to the Montreal Canadiens. 

### Chosen Font 
Roboto for headers and while body text can use Arial for clarity.

### Colour Palette 
Primary Colors: Red (#bf2f38), blue (#213770), and white for the Montreal Canadiens team colors.
Accent Colors: White (#FFFFFF) and grey (#BBBBBB) for background sections to improve readability. 
Hover/Highlight Colors: Dark grey(#AAAAAA) for interactive elements.
